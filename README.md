Lab resource tracker
============

This tool has been designed to monitor usage of all the lab systems, both active and past. It is also used to add, edit and view resource specific details such as platform, HOST IP address etc.  

Functionality
------------

### 1. Resource status (Home) page  ###

  This page shows the reservation status of all the lab systems. Any inactive system could be reserved by pressing the reserve action button. When a system is reserved by a user, the user details along with the purpose for the reservation are shown next to the corresponing lab system. The system could be checked out or returned at a later point by clicking on the return action button. All the columns in the home page are sorted alpha-numerically in both asc and desc orders. 

### 2. Resource usage page  ###

  This page shows the history of all the reserve/return checkpoints by the users. We can further filter the history of user reservations by Resource & Owner names. This can be done by selecting the appropriate resource and owner values as the filter options (present towards the end of the page). All the columns in the Resource usage page are sorted alpha-numerically in both asc and desc orders.

### 2. Resource details page  ###

  This page shows resource specific details such as Resource name, platform, resource IP and SUT IP addresses. The corresponding details for any resource can be edited by clicking on the Edit resource button next to the resource of interest. Any resource can also be removed from the list of lab systems by clicking on the Remove button. When a resource is removed, the row corresponding in the resource status page is simulaneously removed. We can also add new resources by clicking on the Add resource button present at the bottom of the page. When submitted, the newly added system's information will be updated in this page as well as the Resource status page, signifying its existence. 

We can switch between the corresponding web pages by clicking on the appropriate page button in the navigation bar present at the top.
